would using morphological filtering (dilate / erode) on the spectrogram highlight the real audio?

from pixelmator, it seems like raising highlights is useful

I wonder if I'm fixating too much on those high sounds, and not on the rumble that may be the real deal

...and if I'm being thrown off by the log scale to think there's a lot up there
